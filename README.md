## Basic functions for power analysis

This package was originally created by Stephane Champely, from the University of Lyon.

### Getting started

The official release of the package is on CRAN:

To get this package with extended intervals (e.g., for sample sensitivity analysis) installed instead, just write in an R session:

```R
devtools::install_github("SvenHeim-UDE/pwr", subdir="package")
```

After installing, you have to load to use the package, with:

```R
